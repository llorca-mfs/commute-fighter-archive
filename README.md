# Commute Fighter Archive
An archive of a passion project I started in 2020 and have yet to complete.

### Dependencies
This archive contains concepts for levels (located within the levels_concept directory) that you could run on your machine. But to do that, you need to have the following PIP packages installed:
1. PyGame
2. PIL (Python Image Library)
3. NumPy

### How to Run
The only runnable part of this archive are the concept levels. To run them, make sure all the dependencies are installed first, then just run the .py file within the "lvl" directory you want to run
